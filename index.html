    <p>
        Visual Studio Code is coding platform. It is used for coding very complicated apps like: 1)PUBG
        2)GFF. I like coding in Visual Studio Code it is fun, you don't need to type everything there is a
        pickup box or dropdown box you can take the tag from there.

        Console is used as an practice page to practice if our app, game, web app etc. is proper or not
        and Visual Studio Code is the best place to make a console web app, games, apps etc.
        I like making console apps it is fun using variables.
